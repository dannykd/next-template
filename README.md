# Next.js Starter Template with Layout components

This is a template for rapidly starting Next.js projects with built in components relating to page layouts. Inspired by [@clexmente's template](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/branch/other_file.md) with a few added dependencies + a components/layout folder that holds components including a Navbar and Footer components as well as a general Layout component that wraps all the pages.

## What you'll get (a fully formatted page with a responsive navigation bar and footer)

3. Delete the **INSERT_PAGE_PATH.tsx** page or use it as Page template and your project should be ready for your own code!
